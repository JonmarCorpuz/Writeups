## What is the thread ID of the first thread created by notepad.exe?

1. Open up the Logfile.PML file using Procmon by first launching Procmon and then opening the Logfile.PML file

2. Once we opened the Logfile.PML file using Procmon, we'll add a filter to show results for all process activity for notepad.exe, for which the second top result shows us the ID of the first thread created by the notepad.exe process

## What is the stack argument of the previous thread?

4. Clicking on the first top result, which is the previous thread, opens up an Event Properties window in its Event tab, in which we can see this process' thread ID
