# Scanning and Enumeration
> Port Scanning Using Nmap
1. Started up this roomâ€™s machine, as well as our AttackBox
2. `nmap -sC -sV {TARGET-IP} > {FILENAME1}.txt` to perform a network scan to scan for open ports while utilizing default scripts (-sC) and version detection (-sV) to identify services, as well as their versions, and vulnerabilities on the target system, and then redirect the results into a text file
3. `cat {FILENAME1}.txt` to output the scan results from the previous command onto our terminal
```bash
root@ip-10-10-235-180:~# nmap -sC -sV 10.10.226.141 > PortScan.txt
```
```bash
root@ip-10-10-235-180:~# cat PortScan.txt

> Testing User Agents Using Burp Suite
5. Start up Burpsuite Community Edition

![]()

6. Launch Firefox, turn on FoxyProxy, which was already set up by TryHackMe, to allow Burpsuite to capture our web requests and responses

![]()

![]()

8. Seeing that the homepage message was signed by an agent called "**R**", we can send a web request and replace the **User-Agent** value on our intercepted web request to "**R**", which ended displaying the same message that we got before but this time with an error message, which probably indicates that the users' User-Agents are probably also letters of the alphabet as well

![]() 

9. We'll try this theory out by capturing the same web request again but this time we'll send it to Burpsuite's Intruder module and then from there, we'll create a list containing all the capital letters of the alphabet and use it as a payload that we'll inject into our captured web request in the **User-Agent** field

![]()

10. After running our attack, we can see that one of the letters in our payload list got a 302 HTTP status code, meaning that the user has been redirected to another location

![]()

11. We'll create and intercept another web request to the target's homepage but this time we'll replace the User-Agent with the one from our payload list that got the 302 HTTP status code, which ended up redirecting us to a PHP file with its contents displayed onto our browser, which ended up containing the User Agent's name and a message that said that their password is weak

Dear agent J,

All these alien like photos are fake! Agent R stored the real picture inside your directory. Your login password is somehow stored in the fake picture. It shouldn't be a problem for you.

# Command History

# Dissecting Some Commands
`nmap -sC -sV {TARGET-IP} > {FILENAME1}.txt`
+ `-sC` enables the use of default scripts during the scan, which runs a set of commonly used scripts against the target IP to try to find any vulnerabilities
+ `-sV` enables version detection, which attempts to determine the sevice and version information of the open ports
+ `> {FILENAME1}.txt` redirects the results into a text file
