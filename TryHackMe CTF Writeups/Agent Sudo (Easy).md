# Scanning and Enumeration
> Port Scanning Using Nmap
1. Started up this roomâ€™s machine
2. `nmap -sC -sV {TARGET-IP} > {FILENAME1}.txt` to perform a network scan to scan for open ports while utilizing default scripts (-sC) and version detection (-sV) to identify services, as well as their versions, and vulnerabilities on the target system, and then redirect the results into a text file
3. `cat {FILENAME1}.txt` to output the scan results from the previous command

# Dissecting Some Commands
`nmap -sC -sV {TARGET-IP} > {FILENAME1}.txt`
+ `-sC` enables the use of default scripts during the scan, which runs a set of commonly used scripts against the target IP to try to find any vulnerabilities
+ `-sV` enables version detection, which attempts to determine the sevice and version information of the open ports
+ `> {FILENAME1}.txt` redirects the results into a text file
